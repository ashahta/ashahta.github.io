            Neuroplasticity, is the ability of the brain to change and grow throughout one's life. It is responsible for
            the changes that take place when learning to play a musical instrument, speaking a new language, recovering
            from an injury, as well as creating new ways of functioning and new behaviours/habits for those with
            behavioural and mental disabilities. Neuroplasticity isn't anything new. It's been touched on in studies as
            far back as the late 1700's, (but in animals), and then again in 1890, (with the initial term
            <em>plasticity</em>) and then neglected and forgotten for nearly another century as neuroscientists believed
            that the growth of the human brain and function was fixed in adulthood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Contrary to that belief however, the evidence around the 'rewiring' of neural pathways has been sufficiently
            proven, albeit indirectly, through patients who have suffered strokes, people with mental health issues,
            through athletes in training, through musicians and through students. Personally, I found the concept of
            neuroplasticity to be strange to get my head around at first. After dealing with chronic pain on and off,
            over a period spanning nearly 15 years, (with not much answers), I found myself in the chronic pain clinic
            after a really bad period and was introduced to this idea that I could retrain my brain's neural pathways to
            make new connections to strengthen, or overwrite my 'already learned' pain receptors. This was done mainly
            through building up a habit to gradually increase my activity levels, building up to where I am now.

            <em>Neuroplasticity = selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains</em>
            <br>
            <p>
                Researcher, and teacher, Judy Willis basically, summarised the near-exact neuroplasticity process, as
                when an activity is practiced (or a memory recalled) on a regular basis, the neural networks
                (electrochemical pathways) shape themselves according to that activity or memory. If practicing new
                things stops, the brain goes through a “pruning”, eventually eliminating that pathway. “Like in a system
                of freeways connecting various cities, the more cars going to certain destination, the wider the road
                that carries them needs to be. The fewer cars travelling that way, however, the fewer lanes are needed.”
            <br>
                “Cells that fire together, wire together”
                Performing tasks, or recalling information that causes different neurons to work simultaneously,
                strengthens those connections. This then creates “thick, hardy road maps” linking various parts of the
                brain. Stimulating one neuron will more than likely trigger the next one to fire. “Practice makes
                permanent. The more times the network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes.”
                (Willis, "Mind, Brain & Education". 2010)

            <em>Changing Brains in the Classroom</em>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sharing this information with students will also have an affect on their brains - and mindset - too.
                Lisa Blackwell (Columbia University), along with Kali Trzesniewski and Carol Dweck (Stanford
                University), published a study in the journal Child Development in 2007 that found that both morale and
                grades took a leap when students understood that "intelligence is malleable". The students who already
                believed this of themselves did better in school, and also their classmates who had been taught the same
                concept by researchers. The results from the groups were significantly higher than those who had not
                been taught about neuroplasticity.
            <br>
                Willis had also observed that in her own middle school class, her students were more motivated to
                study and engage, because those students knew that they had the capability to "[build] knowledge and
                change their brains".

                    <li>
                        Practice, practice, practice. Repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing material
                        in a variety of ways helps build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Put information in context. Recognizing that learning is, essentially, the formation of new or
                        stronger neural connections, it makes sense to prioritise activities that help students tap into
                        already-existing pathways. For example, combine subjects, or give students projects that allow
                        them to create according to their lives. "Whenever new material is presented in such a way that
                        students see relationships between concepts", writes Willis, "they generate greater brain cell
                        activity and achieve more successful long-term memory storage and retrieval."

                    <li>
                        Let students know that this is how the brain works. Breaking through those neuro-mythological
                        barriers that paint intelligence as predetermined may ease students' minds and encourage them to
                        use their brains. Willis notes, "Especially for students who believe they are 'not smart,' the
                        realization that they can literally change their brains through study and review is empowering."

                Growth Mindset: <em>The Power of Yet</em>
            <br>
            <p>
                Carol Dweck, known for her research on an individual’s implicit theory of intelligence, “In a fixed
                mindset, students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed
                traits. They have a certain amount and that’s that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all
                the time and never look dumb.
            <br>
            <br>
                “In a Growth Mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through
                effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone
                can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.”
            <br>
            <br>
                In her <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099>">Ted Talk</a>, Carol mentioned that the best way to acknowledge someone’s successes or failures -
                or rather, in her example, children - was not to give praise for talent, gifts or for how many A’s
                they received, or for putting them down when their performance was unsatisfactory - but for how they
                took their journey. Having their effort, problem solving strategies acknowledged, and recognised as
                well as having their tried and failed attempts constructively guided did more to validate the
                mindset of “I can get there when I practice.” Dweck specifically gives it the name of praising
                wisely. It gives the feedback and praise more meaning for both parties, especially when that
                confidence is built from the basis of a growth mindset.
