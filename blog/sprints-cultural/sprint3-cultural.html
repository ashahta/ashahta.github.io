    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/emotional_intelligence">
        “Emotional intelligence [mass noun] The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one’s emotions, and to
        handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.”
        <span>Oxford's Lexico</span>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
        As the definition outlines, Emotional Intelligence, or EQ, is the ability to recognise and be mindful of the
        emotions of myself, as well as the emotions of others. The ability to discern and label different feelings as
        they come, and also being able to adjust themselves according to those emotions is also included as a facet of
        EQ.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like all things that are unfamiliar, your Emotional Intelligence grows the more you practice different
        EQ-related skills. These skills are also known as ‘steps’. These three steps are:
        <ol>
            <li>Attention Training</li>
            <li>Self knowledge and Mastery</li>
            <li>Creating Useful Mental Habits</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>
            <p>
                Attention Training
                <br>
                Attention Training is basically being able to pay attention to what is happening in our bodies when we
                feel different emotions. When we first start to mentally be aware of any change in our emotions, our
                body would have already reacted to the change.
                <br>
                We can train our attention to notice those changes, and be more aware of the connection between our
                mind, body and emotions. Doing this helps our minds be more calm, clear and alert.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Self-knowledge and Self Mastery
                <br>
                Following on from attention training, having a clear and alert mind helps us gain more insight to what
                is happening inside ourselves, which is what self-knowledge is.
                <br>
                From having that knowledge of what we’re feeling and how we’re reacting and engaging when those changes
                happen, we can practice mastery over those reactions when they occur. For example, mentally saying to
                ourselves, “Okay, so I know what happens when I feel anxious, I know how much anxiety I feel when this
                thing happens, and I know how to bring myself back.”
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Creating Useful Mental Habits
                <br>
                Whenever those voices of self-doubt, and criticism pop-up during a challenge, it can really throw you
                off-guard. _Especially_ when you know that you are capable, and that you have the knowledge and tools to
                help you.
                This is the same when you start to compare yourself against others and the “superego” starts to come
                through
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>How is it different to Intellectual Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is different from Intellectual Intelligence in the way that EQ focuses on how well I
        understand my own emotions, whereas IQ focuses on my capacity of intellectual intelligence.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>
        The importance of being Emotionally Intelligent, (or rather, striving to be), ensures that I am able to
        recognize the emotions I have and adjust my own behaviours in accordance to those emotions in order to relieve
        stress, overcome challenges while studying, and also be more empathetic with the feelings of those around me.
        Having a sound understanding of the importance of EQ helps foster skills like effective communication, conflict
        resolution, and more social awareness.
