        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/emotional_intelligence">
            “Emotional intelligence [mass noun] The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one’s emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.”
            <span>Oxford's Lexico</span>
          </blockquote>
          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
                As the definition outlines, Emotional Intelligence, or EQ, is the ability to recognise and be mindful of the emotions of myself, as well as the emotions of others. The ability to discern and label different feelings as they come, and also being able to adjust themselves according to those emotions is also included as a facet of EQ. 
            </p>
          <h2>How is it different to Intellectual Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
                Emotional Intelligence is different from Intellectual Intelligence in the way that EQ focuses on how well I understand my own emotions, whereas IQ focuses on my capacity of intellectual intelligence.
            </p>
          <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>
                The importance of being Emotionally Intelligent, (or rather, striving to be), ensures that I am able to recognize the emotions I have and adjust my own behaviours in accordance to those emotions in order to relieve stress, overcome challenges while studying, and also be more empathetic with the feelings of those around me. Having a sound understanding of the importance of EQ helps foster skills like effective communication, conflict resolution, and more social awareness.
