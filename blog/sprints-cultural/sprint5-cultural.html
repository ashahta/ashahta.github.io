        <h2>What are the three new things I have learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            The three new things that I learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning were my persistence through the challenges I had faced, being brave enough to ask for help when I needed it (even if it was just one person), and being more open and grateful for the satisfaction from the little victories.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
            The role that values, empathy and self-awareness play in learning and programming are vital in that it gives someone a solid foundation of what that person deems important to them, whether that is family-oriented thinking in a potential employer, the values of being responsible for ones' own self, having transparency (to name a few), being supportive towards others in your cohort, or in your job, and also just in life. The connection of these roles to learning is made when you know what you want to achieve and aspire to be able to learn in a way that doesn't compromise your own views, or , also in programming when you form, hopefully, positive relationships throughout your career that are based on the values you have, your empathy towards others and self-awareness in how you are a human being and indiviual.
        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            What surprised me the most about core learning were the opportunities to look deeper into how shifting our mindset towards how we learn, that played a huge part during the learning of the technical skills - and thus boosting that self-confidence. I think also being able to practice an introspective mindset also surprised me as well, because then how do we learn from our reflections?
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most challenging aspects of the core learning had to be getting used to the idea that our introspection while learning was just as important than learning without. It's hard to write that much about yourself *especially* when you know that there are others who are in the boat with you. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why do I think that EDA, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development course?</h2>
        <p>
            I think that EDA spends this much time on focusing on core learning skills as sometimes when learning is just focusing on the content related, it's hard to keep a track on how you are growing as a person. 
        </p>
        <h2>Does the time I spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should I have just used that time to practice programming instead?</h2>
        <p>
            I feel as though the time I spent studying the core learning side was well spent, because it adds another skill-set that contributes to your technical knowledge as well.
