    <h1>My Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>What are my long term goals and career path?</h2>
        <p>
            My goals and career path have basically stayed now that I prepare for Bootcamp. I still want to gain the skills of a full-stack developer, and also in the future, get into Test-Driven Development.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you think my biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>
            After going through my previous strengths and limitations, I think that one of my strengths will be to plan a strategy in order to be able to write the actually code. I also think that my strength in individualisation will be of use in working with the other people who are in my cohort.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            My biggest challenge will be to try and keep to timebox suggestions as well as being able to keep a level head and go for when I will be frustrated. 
        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>
                The skills I would most like to see developed in myself while at EDA would include better communication skills, more developed sense of the growth mindset, and self-affirmation, as well as a honed-down problem-solving mindset.
            </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
            <p>
               Basically, what I expect from the facilitation team would be transparency in communication, regular
                catch-ups, and support and advice.</p>
            </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
            One of the conditions I had placed on myself before even applying for the programme is that I would seek and
            ask for help, as much as I am able, whenever I would be stuck. I fully intend to be committed to seeking
            help through EDA’s Slack foundations and code-help-desk channels, search for a solution in the channels
            before asking my own question and also try to keep in regular contact with other learners and facilitators.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1>My Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>My long term goals and ideal career pathway</h2>
        <p>I chose to join and grow with EDA in order to gain the skills of a full-stack developer and be able to work
            for myself, collaborate with designers and pursue personal projects. Eventually, however, I do want to apply
            these skills into the stream of software testing, (and still develop on the side).</p>
        <h2>Non-technical skills would I like to see developed in myself while at EDA</h2>
        <p>The skills I would most like to see developed in myself while at EDA would include better communication
            skills, more developed sense of the growth mindset, and self-affirmation, as well as a honed-down
            problem-solving mindset. </p>
        <h2>My strengths and limitations?
            (How would I apply these strengths, effectively & productively,
            to manage my workload, and while working with other learners, despite my limitations)</h2>
        <p>I think that out of the strengths from that list, the ones that will help me the most with my learning
            Ideation, Individualization, and Strategy. I actually feel that all five could cross over easily, and be of
            benefit to me in my journey. Where I lack in focus, calmness, timeboxing, I could use strategies to help
            combat and overcome those obstacles. The Problem Solving Process and Framework would be beneficial as a
            strategic guide. Individualization would be really helpful when the time comes to pair with another cohort
            buddy, as I love getting to know the people I work with in a way that allows for a more harmonious
            collaboration. </p>
        <p>Based on these strengths, and limitations, I am fully aware of the possibilities that I could be completely
            overwhelmed and quit before I start. As mentioned in my previous description, applying the strategies of The
            Problem Solving Process and Framework, as well as keeping a regular check on the timeboxing guidelines when
            I feel myself feeling overwhelmed, would be useful while I try to manage my workload during this programme.
            I will also make sure to be able to communicate my intentions with other learners, facilitators and
            representatives, in order to work productively and safely.</p>
        <h2>A commitment to seeking help when I need it</h2>
        <p>One of the conditions I had placed on myself before even applying for the programme is that I would seek and
            ask for help, as much as I am able, whenever I would be stuck. I fully intend to be committed to seeking
            help through EDA’s Slack foundations and code-help-desk channels, search for a solution in the channels

        </p>
        <h2>My expectations from the facilitation team</h2>
        <p>Basically, what I expect from the facilitation team would be transparency in communication, regular
            catch-ups, and support and advice.</p>
        <h2>My block-out times</h2>
        <p>The block-out times for me _until bootcamp_ would be two-three hours on Monday nights, as I spend time with
            my family when everyone is home, and occasionally two hours in the evening on Thursdays and Tuesdays. I also
            have a fortnightly 1hr-therapy session every second week, which is aimed to take place around 2.30~3pm
            during a weekday.</p>
