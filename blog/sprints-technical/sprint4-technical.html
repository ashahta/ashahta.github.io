            Let me tell you a couple of stories about when I got blocked.
        </h2>
        <p>
            In this sprint, (as well as the last), I've been learning about JavaScript and the DOM. As much as I thought
            that learning JS would be a, (if not easy), fun challenge, it was indeed in the end, a challenge. A
            frustratingly tedious, and devious challenge. There were multiple times where my partner, his flatmates and
            my family had to witness/hear my groans of defeat and faceplanking on the floor while going through the
            exercises and working on the various kata that repeatedly kicked my head in. Not even the mindfulness
            exercises on Headspace could help me. Nor the problem solving steps that I had put in place to get through
            the challenges that came my way. Somehow I got through them...
            <br>
            Barely.
        </p>
        <p>
            One particular challenge that turned out to be so simple, was a version of the FizzBuzz challenge: the Super
            FizzBuzz challenge. This challenge required myself and those in our cohort to write a function that would
            take a number from an array, and then would return either a number, the words "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz"
            when certain conditions were met.
            While trying to get the code I had written to pass, and failing each time, I decided to show a cohort buddy
            my code, in the hopes of having a fresh pair of eyes to review my work. It turned out that what I had been
            missing was an if statement and the proper argument, <em>num</em>.

            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Another challenge that I had, and was able to solve easily, (and in my opinion, elegantly), was basically
            solved within half the time that was suggested. This challenge, JS Gradebook, involved creating a function
            that would take previously given names, and scores of a group of students, (data), and then return their
            average score based on their grades total. I think that the reason why this challenge was efficiently
            completed, was because I had decided to pre-write my pseudo-code, <em>as well as</em> the code I was meant
            to write. Being able to write this "draft" meant that when I would have to make changes to the code, I
            wouldn't have to do more work in re-adapting my code to function the way it should. I learned that writing a
            draft or a plan before jumping into writing the code was not only more efficient, but also satisfying in the
            sense that my head was all over the place.
