        </h1>
        <h2>
            What is the difference between HTML and CSS?
        </h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            HTML is like an actual body. You have the head, which is where your brain (metadata) is stored, then you
            have the body, which is where all your organs (elements) are compacted away with their own uses and
            then you have your legs and feet - closing tags for the body and for the html document as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the head, sits all the information, or metadata, that is needed for the page to function, speak in the
            language you want it to and also the neural pathways that link external sources of information like the
            title of your webpage, your CSS stylesheet and font styles. There is no limit to how many meta-elements you
            can add. After the head comes the rest of the body that is made up of headers, paragraphs, tables, lists and
            images and so on. These elements "flesh out" and grow however way you like, but just like our actual bodies,
            we need clothes. Thats where CSS comes in.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS is a separate "sheet" that includes the data needed to clothe, or style your html code so that your html
            code can be shown to others in the way that you would like it to. You can set the color for the background
            of your page, add fonts for any text, as well as configure the spacing of each element (alignment).
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>
        Control Flow and Loops
    </h2>
    <p>
        The term Control Flow refers to the process that a script will follow when being executed. It flows through the
        script (or instructions), until it is told to break this flow and loop back to the start, or do something else
        until that output is achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of this is also seen in music. You play a piece of music as its' written, playing through a verse
        into a chorus, and then maybe repeating that verse again, or starting a new verse, then another chorus, or maybe
        even a bridge, or instrumental break until you reach the end of the song having the outro signify the end
        output.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The DOM
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Document Object Model, or the DOM, is basically the glue that links HTML and CSS to JavaScript. It is an
        interface used to help programmers manipulate HTML elements on a page, shaping our page however way we like.
        Because a JavaScript Document object is provided to us through a browser, full of different properties and
        methods to allow us to carry out manipulations, it is also seen as a "Family Tree" of Objects - except each
        object, method and property has one parent.

    <h2>
        Accessing Data from Arrays & Objects
    </h2>
    <p>
        In JavaScript, Objects are known as a collection of properties (or things), with an association between a name, (or key), and a value. An array on the other hand is a specific kind of object, that can hold varying amounts of values, and are also useful when creating a collection of data. 
        <br>
        Accessing, adding and removing data from objects requires the user to use bracket or dot notation. The process differs for arrays in that arrays use zero-based indexing - the first item in an array is assigned to #0, instead of one, so when wanting to access data, we would request it based on its' numerical value in the array. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        Functions
    </h2>
    <p>
        A Function in JavaScript is basically a set of instructions ("statements") that perform tasks within a webpage (or web application). Functions are important because they help a webpage built with HTML and CSS be more than just a basic, or static webpage. They are also used to create boundaries for DOM to simplify the composition of the application.
