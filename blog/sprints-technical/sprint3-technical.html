        What is the difference between HTML and CSS?

        <p>
                HTML is like an actual body. You have the head, which is where your brain (_metadata_) is stored, then you have the body, which is where all your organs (_elements_) are compacted away with their own uses and then you have your legs and feet - closing tags for the body and for the html document as a whole. 

                In the head, sits all the information, or metadata, that is needed for the page to function, speak in the language you want it to and also the neural pathways that link external sources of information like the title of your webpage, your CSS stylesheet and font styles. There is no limit to how many meta-elements you can add. After the head comes the rest of the body that is made up of headers, paragraphs, tables, lists and images and so on. These elements "flesh out" and grow however way you like, but just like our actual bodies, we need clothes. Thats where CSS comes in. 
                
                CSS is a separate "sheet" that includes the data needed to clothe, or style your html code so that your html code can be shown to others in the way that you would like it to. You can set the color for the background of your page, add fonts for any text, as well as configure the spacing of each element (alignment).
