            Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration
        </h1>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Since childhood, up until my mid-20’s, I have been told by family and friends that I’ve always been seen as
        bubbly, bright and inquisitive, always ready to help and lead others and always ready to sing in choirs, speak
        in church and act - a textbook extrovert. However, I had also always been struggling with bouts of anxiety and
        inadequacy. After having my mental health and confidence challenged over the past few years, that extroverted
        side of me has lessened considerably, and I have been gradually building up my confidence to get me to where I
        am now.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        While building up my confidence again, I’ve been reflecting a lot on how some of my core values and identity
        have stayed the same despite these issues.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Growing up in a very semi-traditional Samoan, and Latter-Day Saint household taught me from a young age to be of
        service to others, to be humble and reach out to others regardless of any differences. My involvement in church
        choirs, leading youth groups and teaching children helped reinforce the values of serving, belonging, having
        accountability, compassion, empathy and humility.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>
        Was there a situation where I had an ethical decision to make? How did you weigh up the values involved in that
        decision? What were the consequences of the action I took?
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        A situation where I have had an ethical decision to make would be when I had to make the decision to resign from
        my last job in order to get help for clinical depression instead of staying in my role to support my family. As
        someone who had been working ever since I left high school, this decision was especially hard to make, as the
        only other person who could work was my mum. The addition of my sister who was studying at the time was also on
        my mind. As I value supporting, serving and being mindful about the happiness of my family, I had to be honest
        and let go of being independent, about when I needed help. Being open and honest helped me realise that I didn’t
        need to be afraid to ask for that help, and led to the consequence of having the support of my family for the
        next three years, regardless of the extra lack of income.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Strengths and Limitations
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        While evaluating my strengths and limitations, I actually remembered that I had already done the Strengths
        Finder quiz a few years ago. Despite my own personal changes, the list still applies, but shows in different
        ways.

    <h2>
        What strengths will help me grow the most in my learning and career development?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I think that out of the strengths from that list, the ones that will help me the most with my learning Ideation,
        Individualization, and Strategy. I actually feel that all five could cross over easily, and be of benefit to me
        in my journey. Where I lack in focus, calmness, timeboxing, I could use strategies to help combat and overcome
        those obstacles. The Problem Solving Process and Framework would be beneficial as a strategic guide.
        Individualization would be really helpful when the time comes to pair with another cohort buddy, an even when I
        eventually collaborate with a colleague. Having that ability to adapt to other peoples' differences and work
        with each other effectively, is something I look forward to developing further!

    <h2>
        What was an experience where I had to work with others, but had resistance and tension to block the way?
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        As for an example of trying to work productively, and encountering resistance or tension, I had one issue where
        someone from my team had been taking the work I was supposed to be doing while I was offsite in another work
        location, as a part of my role. There had been some tension between us previously, as she had assumed that I
        should have been at a higher level and that I wasn’t competent enough for my job, even though I had been part of
        the team for a few weeks, and was still in training. Our boss knew that, and disregarded her complaint when she
        brought it up during a meeting. So when I had noticed that my work was being taken, I made a plan to still
        handle the situation civilly and approach her about it, rather than bring it up during a meeting. I also had the
        support of a couple of colleagues who had noticed the changing work, and they knew that I still do the same work
        when I’m off-site. When I approached this one colleague, I let her know that I had noticed my work being
        reassigned by her, without my being consulted first. And she explained that she assumed that on those days that
        I wasn’t on-site, that I wasn’t doing anything. When I cleared up that I was, in fact, trying to do the work
        that was assigned to me, she apologised for the misunderstanding, and agreed to not interfere. We actually
        turned out to be pretty close by the time I had left. I think that just having the approach of being
        understanding about the situation, rather than acting aggressively or being petty, helped to foster a more
        favorable outcome.
